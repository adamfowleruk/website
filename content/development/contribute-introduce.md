<p class="intro">As a new contributor to Haiku it's a good idea to get to know the other developers and meet others who are working on areas that you are interested in.</p>

Haiku developers tend to develop both the core Kernel of the operating system as well as Haiku native applications and ports of non-native applications, although some do specialise.

Many developers for Haiku hang out on the Internet Relay Chat (IRC) channel #haiku on freenode.net. For details on how to join, please see the <a href="/community/irc">Community IRC page</a>.

There is also an active web based forum that includes current and past information for both users and developers. This can be found at <a href="https://discuss.haiku-os.org/">https://discuss.haiku-os.org/</a>.

Last but not least, there are the <a href="/community/ml">Haiku Developer Mailing Lists</a> where you can ask developers your questions. In particular, the haiku-3rdparty-dev list is for application developers to discuss existing and new applications built for Haiku.
