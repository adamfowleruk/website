<p class="intro">When building any application you should consider using the Haiku API building blocks. These are native Haiku libraries that make creating Haiku applications easy.</p>

These API perform very well on Haiku, and benefit from being able to use Haiku Messaging, Application Tiling and Stacking, and the Be Filesystem - which platform-independent toolkits like Qt or GTK+ lack.

There is a dedicated <a href="/docs/api">book for the Haiku API</a> which includes an introduction to each API area, as well as small code samples for key features.
