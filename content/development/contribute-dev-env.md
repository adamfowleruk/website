<p class="intro">The first thing you'll need to do before writing code in Haiku is to set up a development environment. How you do this will depend on whether you are developing for Haiku within Haiku itself, or from another operating system.</p>

In future we hope to provide step by step guides for each platform. For now though, whichever of the below routes you take, see the summary: <a href="/guides/building/pre-reqs">Building pre-requisities page</a> for details.

### Developing Haiku on Haiku

**Recommended**: All development tools required to use Haiku as your development environment are now included. Simply <a href="/get-haiku" title="Get Haiku!">download the latest official release</a> or the <a href="https://download.haiku-os.org">latest and unstable nightly images</a>, and you should have everything you need.

### Cross-compiling from Other Systems

While we encourage using Haiku to build Haiku and/or software for Haiku, it is also possible to cross-compile from other operating systems. If you choose to cross-compile from another system, the <a href="/guides/building/pre-reqs">Pre-Requisite Software for Compiling Haiku</a> guide may be a good reference for each supported development environment.
