<p class="intro">When you spot a need for an application it is tempting to create a new one from scratch. The Haiku Archives contains many projects that were started as an idea, and then fell out of use.</p>

<p>To minimise code waste and maximise re-use, you should consider finding a project that aligns with your goals, and adding your own new feature enhancements to it, rather than default to create Yet Another Application.</p>

<p>You can start by looking for active projects that already exist. Use the <a href="/docs/userguide/en/applications/haikudepot">HaikuDepot application</a> within Haiku to search for the type of application you wish to create.</p>

<p>If it doesn't exist there, go over to the Haiku Archive GitHub site and see if you can find an application there that may have gone stale and is in need of a new owner. Each Archive project has its own GitHub repository under here: https://github.com/haikuarchives</p>

<p>If you know of a good application in Linux or which is cross platform and open source, then consider writing a quick port script for that and adding it to the Haiku Ports Project. You can find more information on existing ports here: https://github.com/haikuports/haikuports , or look to create your own port by reading the porting guide links at the bottom of this page: https://github.com/haikuports/haikuports/wiki</p>

<p>If all else fails, <a href="/development/contribute-introduce">contact other developers</a> on IRC or the Forums and ask for recommendations, or let them know your development plans and ask for other volunteers. The Haiku developers are a friendly and helpful bunch and will be happy to point you in the right direction!</p>
